### Brief Description
Following project was made for the client. He asked to write the program which scraped phone numbers from the craigslist.com. Because of Google Captcha scraping results are  extremly limited.
(Following version works for Ubuntu OS)

### Used tools
I have used IntelliJ IDEA as IDE.
For data extracting I have used SeleniumHQ browser automation tool.
For formatting and putting this gathered data into Excel Apache POI library is used.
Both this libraries are imported and managed with Maven.
